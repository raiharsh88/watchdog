# Watchdog

Watchdog is a semi autonomous forest surveillance system that comprises of an array of wireless cameras, distributed strategically to provide monitoring of key remote places within a sanctuary.

When a person is detected in the frame of a video stream, that frame is forwarded to the database with a bounding box around the person and also the confidence of detection in percentage.

These images can then be viewed on the dashboard after which the necessary steps to prevent poaching can be taken. 

The Front End of the dashboard has been built using HTML , ![CSS] ,JS , ReactJS , Styled Components. NextJS has also been used for providing server side rendering and simplifying the routing process.

Signup does not requires any Otp verification as the app is just a test project.
